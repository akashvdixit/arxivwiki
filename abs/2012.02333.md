## Main idea
"We develop the first end-to-end hybrid approach that automatically locates efficient cut positions to cut a large quantum circuit into smaller subcircuits that are each independently executed by using quantum devices with fewer qubits"

CutQC is a circuit cutting technique (along with some other fancy tools) that can automatically locate the optimal place to cut a circuit, as well as (somewhat) efficiently reconstruct the probability distribution using what's called in the paper "Dynamic Definition" query algorithm.


## Results
"CutQC offers an average of 60X to 8600X runtime speedup over classical simulation alternatives for different benchmarks"

The overall fidelities of the cut-and-reconstructed distributions are significantly improved as compared to running the full circuits on a 20-qubit IBM machine (figure 11) except the approcimate quantum fourier transform where the cut-and-reconstructed is worse than the full run.
