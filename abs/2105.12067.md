## Main idea

Construct a toy model of AdS-CFT correspondence that recovers three main properties:
1. Local boundary operators
2. Complementary recovery
3. Exact RT formula

No previous toy model has all of these properties.
This uses Hamiltonian simulation on top of random tensors.

One caveat: this model is not Lorentz invariant.
