## Main idea

How does one deal with incoherent noise (i.e., noise that can't be made better with better measurements?)

We often model incoherent noise as Pauli noise.

There are lots of techniques to deal with this, mostly under the name "benchmarking".
The introduced noise method (ACES) unifies several "benchmarking" techniques known before (randomized benchmarking (RB), interleaved RB, simultaneous
RB).
