## Main idea

We establish a theory for near-optimal unambiguous discrimination of coherent states using practical receivers.


## Results

Quantum mechanics forbids perfect discrimination of non-orthogonal quantum states. However, it is still possible to unambiguously discriminate a set of quantum states if one allows a non-zero probability for inconclusive discrimination. This is known as unambiguous state discrimination (USD).

Peres and Terno provided a formal mathematical description for globally optimal measurement schemes for USD. However, it is difficult to realise these measurements with currently available technologies. 

In this work, we construct near optical decoders for USD of coherent states, which are used extensively in quantum optical technologies. Our decoders are designed using only linear passive optics (LOP) unitaries, phase-space displacement, auxiliary vacuum modes, and on-off mode-wise photodetection. We illustrate that this set of receiver resources is sufficient to approach the ultimate bound set by Peres and Terno, for randomly picked coherent-state constellations.
