## Background

kXOR is a constraint satisfaction problem where every clause involves $$k$$ Boolean variables. Their combined parity must be either even or odd.

The threshold algorithm is [competitive with QAOA on MaxCut](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.07047), which is why it was studied here.

## Main idea

There are four parts:
* A formula for the performance of the depth-1 QAOA on regular, triangle-free instances of kXOR. It doesn't depend on the number of variables.
* A formula for the performance of the (classical) threshold algorithm on regular, triangle-free instances of kXOR.

With these two parts, you can compare the performances. The QAOA is better than the threshold algorithm for $$k > 4$$.

* The best possible performance given a large random regular kXOR instance.
This value is calculated from a connection to spin glass theory.
The code is [available here](https://nbviewer.jupyter.org/github/marwahaha/QuAIL-2021/blob/main/parisi.ipynb) and could be used for more types of CSPs.

With this part, you can compare the best possible performance with that of the algorithms above.
The best possible performance scales as $$1/2 + \Theta(\sqrt{k/D})$$ but the other algorithms scale much more poorly with $$k$$.

* A proof that some fully-satisfiable Max 3XOR instances cannot be solved with QAOA until the depth is logarithmic with the number of variables.
This is proven through a weak version of the NLTS conjecture. It extends a main result in [Bravyi et al](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.08980).
