## Main idea

Two main results. 

1. How hard is it to estimate a quantum partition function?
* It's as hard as "quantum approximate counting"
* It's as hard as "quantum density-of-states"

2. New efficient algorithm for estimating the free energy of dense local Hamiltonians (with extensive error):
* Use a variational characterization of the free energy
* Use a convex relation that keeps the local marginals consistent up to small neighborhoods, but higher marginals not necessarily consistent
* Then round ("correlation rounding") to achieve the solution.
* This also needs a technical adjustment from entropy to "pseudo-entropy" in the relaxed problem.
