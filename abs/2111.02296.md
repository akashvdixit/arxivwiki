## Main idea

Consider polynomially many queries to some oracle $C$ (where $C$ is like NP or QMA).

In general, they are adaptive queries to $$C$$. Draw a DAG corresponding to the dependency graph of the queries.
If the DAG has treewidth $$d$$, then the problem is in $$P^{C[d log]}$$.

This extends the connections between $$P^{QMA[log]} = P^{||QMA}$$ and  between $$P^{NP[log]} = P^{||NP}$$ to query graphs with bounded treewidth.
