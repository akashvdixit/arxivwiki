## Main idea

How do you simulate an oscillating Hamiltonian? Many existing protocols have error in $$ \| H \| $$ and in $$ \| \partial H \| $$. 

Idea ("qHOP"): Drop the time ordering, and use a Riemann sum to approximate. It only has a **log** dependence on the norm of the derivative, because of some LCU techniques.

This also achieves a second-order convergence when studying the Schrodinger equation. (This is surprising!) Numerical evidence and a proof using PDEs/pseudo-differential calculus are given.

Can be generalized to higher-order.
