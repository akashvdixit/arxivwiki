## Main idea

What's the power of a quantum agent vs a classical agent when learning about the physical world?

### Learning physical systems

* When learning about an unknown copy of $$\rho$$, storing quantum memory is better than storing classical memory.
* When predicting many properties (i.e. Pauli measurements), quantum agent needs exponentially fewer measurements, *even when $$\rho$$ is unentangled.**
* When learning the largest eigenvector (i.e. PCA), quantum agent needs exponentially fewer measurements.

### Learning physical dynamics

Assume there's an unknown quantum process (CPTP map).
Learning this process is exponentially easier for a quantum agent.

### Experimental demonstration

(on Google Sycamore)
* learning states
* distinguishing general and T-symmetric dynamics)
