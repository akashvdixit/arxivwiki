## Main idea

Simulate a geometrically local quantum circuit in any number of dimensions D.

Previous work was for 2 dimensions plus a small thickness, and 3 dimensions. This work finds a recursion to handle any number of dimesnions D.

In limited settings, it has polynomial running time, but in general, it is quasipolynomial.
